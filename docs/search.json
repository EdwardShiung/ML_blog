One of the goals of statistics is to infer population characteristics based on sample data. Probability theory provides a framework to make inferences about population characteristics by observing the probability distribution in the sample.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing\nIn statistical analysis, hypothesis testing is a common task, involving statistical inferences about a hypothesis. Probability theory offers probability distributions and testing methods, allowing us to assess the difference between observed data and the expected outcomes under a specific hypothesis.\n\n\nConfidence Intervals\nProbability theory is also relevant to the construction of confidence intervals. Confidence intervals provide estimates for parameter values, and probability theory provides tools to quantify the uncertainty associated with such estimates."

Probability theory concepts play a key role in constructing such models, especially in the development of probability models like Bayesian models.\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, models aim to discover patterns in data without relying on labels. Probability theory concepts such as clustering and probability density estimation find applications in unsupervised learning.\n\n\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning involves agents learning through interaction with an environment. Probability theory concepts like stochastic processes and Markov decision processes are useful for modeling such interactive processes."
