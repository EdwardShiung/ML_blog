It is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance or randomness, providing a way to assign numerical values to the possible outcomes of a random experiment.\n\n## Types of Random Variables:\n\n### 1. Discrete Random Variable:\n   - A discrete random variable takes on a finite or countably infinite set of distinct values.\n   - The probability distribution is described by a Probability Mass Function (PMF), specifying the probability of each possible value.\n\n### 2. Continuous Random Variable:\n   - A continuous random variable can take on any value within a certain range.\n   - The probability distribution is described by a Probability Density Function (PDF), indicating the probability of the random variable falling within a particular interval.\n\nThe key purpose of a random variable is to enable the mathematical analysis of uncertain outcomes, allowing the application of probability theory and statistical methods. Random variables are crucial in various fields, providing a framework for modeling and understanding uncertainty in a quantitative manner.\n\n",
