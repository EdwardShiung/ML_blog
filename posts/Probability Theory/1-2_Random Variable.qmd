Random Variable
-
A **random variable** is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that allows us to represent and quantify uncertain outcomes of a random process or experiment. It is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance or randomness, providing a way to assign numerical values to the possible outcomes of a random experiment.

## Types of Random Variables:

### 1. Discrete Random Variable:
   - A discrete random variable takes on a finite or countably infinite set of distinct values.
   - The probability distribution is described by a Probability Mass Function (PMF), specifying the probability of each possible value.

### 2. Continuous Random Variable:
   - A continuous random variable can take on any value within a certain range.
   - The probability distribution is described by a Probability Density Function (PDF), indicating the probability of the random variable falling within a particular interval.

The key purpose of a random variable is to enable the mathematical analysis of uncertain outcomes, allowing the application of probability theory and statistical methods. Random variables are crucial in various fields, providing a framework for modeling and understanding uncertainty in a quantitative manner.
