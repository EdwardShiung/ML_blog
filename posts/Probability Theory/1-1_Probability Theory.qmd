Probability Theory
-
**Probability Theory** is a mathematical discipline that studies the likelihood of events and the rules governing their occurrence. It provides a formal framework for expressing, analyzing, and manipulating uncertainty, randomness, and chance. The fundamental concept is probability, a numerical measure ranging from 0 to 1, representing the likelihood of a particular event occurring. Probability theory is extensively used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, physics, finance, and many others, to model and analyze uncertain situations.

Probability Theory and Statistics
-
### Inferential Statistics
Probability theory plays a crucial role in inferential statistics. One of the goals of statistics is to infer population characteristics based on sample data. Probability theory provides a framework to make inferences about population characteristics by observing the probability distribution in the sample.

### Hypothesis Testing
In statistical analysis, hypothesis testing is a common task, involving statistical inferences about a hypothesis. Probability theory offers probability distributions and testing methods, allowing us to assess the difference between observed data and the expected outcomes under a specific hypothesis.

### Confidence Intervals
Probability theory is also relevant to the construction of confidence intervals. Confidence intervals provide estimates for parameter values, and probability theory provides tools to quantify the uncertainty associated with such estimates.

Probability Theory and Machine Learning
-
### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, models are typically trained from labeled data, and these models are then used to predict outcomes for new, unlabeled data. Probability theory concepts play a key role in constructing such models, especially in the development of probability models like Bayesian models.

### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, models aim to discover patterns in data without relying on labels. Probability theory concepts such as clustering and probability density estimation find applications in unsupervised learning.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves agents learning through interaction with an environment. Probability theory concepts like stochastic processes and Markov decision processes are useful for modeling such interactive processes.
