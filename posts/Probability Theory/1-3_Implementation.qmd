Based on note 1-2, we know that there are two different kinds of random variables. One is a discrete random variable, which takes on two or more distinct outcomes; the other is a continuous random variable, indicating the probability of the random variable falling within a particular interval. To help you warn up, I will provide you two basic examples and briefly explain what is the differences between them. Let's started!!

# Discrete Random Variable
The typical example is tossing the coin or rolling the dice. Here, I choose dice example to be the example. In order to get the better result, I roll the dice 100000000 times, which will close to the nature law.

```{python}
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
# Number of simulations for rolling the dice
num_simulation = 100000000;
# Record the number of occurrences for each dice outcome
results = {1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0};
# Simulate rolling the dice
for _ in range(num_simulation):
    roll_result = random.randint(1,6);
    results[roll_result] += 1;
# Calculate the Probability into probabilities

probabilities = {key: value / num_simulation for key, value in results.items()};
# Demonstrate each number probabilities
print("Dice Number\tProbabilities");
for key, value in probabilities.items():
    print(f"{key}\t\t{value:.3f}");
```

```{python}
# Using Bar Chart demonstrate Probability Distribution
plt.bar(probabilities.keys(), probabilities.values());
plt.xlabel('Dice Number');
plt.ylabel('Probability');
plt.title('Dice Probability Distribution');
plt.show();
```

As you can see, the outcome of probability is close to average (1/6)
