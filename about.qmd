<!-- # About Me -->
I am currently a MS Computer Science student at Virginia Tech, but prior to that, I worked as a Full-End Developer for Grant Thornton and Ernst & Young in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taipei. My main responsibility was to design web applications and financial operating systems, including the EY-Virtual platform. Additionally, I have expertise in utilizing Predictive Data Analytics and Machine Learning to evaluate internal controls and net assets.
